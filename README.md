Within this repository there are three files completed to meet the requirements of the assignment. 
    1. part_1_mars_news - Completed file
    2. part_2_mars_weather - Completed file
    3. mars_weather_data.csv - Exported CSV file to satisfy part 2. 
Additionally, the analysis below was created to meet the requirements of part 2.

#### Minimum Temperature

Month 3 had the lowest average temperature at approximately -83 degrees celsius. Whereas month 8 had the highest average temperature of -68 degrees celsius.

#### Atmospheric Pressure

Month 6 had the lowest average atmospheric pressureat approximately 745. Whereas month 9 had the highest average atmospheric pressure of 913.

#### Year Length

After reviewing the minimum temperature over time line graph above, the length of a year is aproximately 625 days. The number of days were calculated by estimating the number of days between each crest of the line graph. This gave an idea of when the temperatures cycled back to the same time of year.
